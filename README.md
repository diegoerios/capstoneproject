Why would you want to detect emotion in voice in the first place?
Three months ago, I would have never thought I was going to be able to finish this project.
I found the idea cool at first but then realized it actually can have multiple applications in the real world.
Understanding how to work with audio and extract features from an audio file was a big challenge worth pursuing.
Have you ever called your airline or bank and all you got was an automatic answering machine asking you a bunch of questions?
The whole process forces you to be patient. It’s very cumbersome and frustrating experience from a customer point of view.
Now imagine you are upset.
More than upset… you are pissed off with the company and make a call!
You call back and still get an automatic answering machine.

What if the machine could detect this emotion?
What if it could detect from your voice that you are really upset.
What if the answering machine instead of keep asking you questions, it would send you directly to an agent or human to try and solve your problem.
I am not sure if they would solve your problem, but it would definitely be a much better experience from a customer point of view.
That is just one example in which you could try to recognize speech emotion with machine learning and improve customer services for a call center:
Detect emotion in automated calls to speed-up customer service
Detect emotion in WhatsApp chatbots voice notes
Improve tasks in smart speakers (alexa, google assistant, and so on)
Are you actually able to detect emotion through voice?
Yes!
It took me some time to work on this project but after some testing, I used a one dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and got a 76% accuracy.

How did I achieve this accuracy?

Project Description
For this project, my primary objective was answering this question: Can we detect emotion from audio files?
At first I was not sure about how this could be used, but after talking with data scientists in the Vancouver area, it seems like there are plenty of uses for it.
